# Architecture

QueueLess is a cloud-native monorepo with four independently deployed modules.

## Module map

```
frontend/   React 19 + Vite SPA ──────────▶ Vercel   (static + CDN)
backend/    Node 20 + Express REST API ───▶ Render   (web service)
firebase/   RTDB rules + Cloud Functions ─▶ Firebase (Spark plan)
analytics/  Python pandas + scikit-learn ─▶ CI artifact (predictions.json)
```

## Data flow

```

- **Firebase RTDB** is the operational store: queue state, tokens, staff,
  admins, custom queues, presence, appointments, config.
- **Clients cannot write operational or content-bearing RTDB data** — those
  writes go through the JWT API. Scoped staff presence is the only direct
  client-write exception.
- **`hospital/patients`** (Medical industry) holds patient PII — demographics
  plus a **salted HMAC of the Aadhaar number** and its last 4 digits (never the
  raw number). Backend-only via the Admin SDK; `.read`/`.write` denied to
  clients. Served exclusively through `/api/v1/patients/*` (a public
  `:id/status` endpoint returns only a first name + status). A background
  sweeper expires stale un-checked-in registrations.
- **MongoDB + CSV** are the analytical event log (dual-write, both optional).

## Real-time model (no Firebase Auth required)

Content-bearing collections (messages, notifications, shared files, AI
conversations) are **not client-readable**. Clients subscribe to
content-free *signal nodes* (`messageSignals/*`, `notificationSignals/*`);
on a bump they refetch through the authenticated API, which enforces
membership/RBAC server-side.

## Backend layering

```
routes → middleware (auth: requireAdmin / requireStaff / requireRole)
       → controllers (thin)
       → services (queue, queueAdmin, messaging, notification, share,
                   upload, prediction, analytics, audit, auth, staff)
       → config (env via Joi, firebase refs, roles)
events/  in-process event bus (token.referred, queue.created, message.sent…)
ai/      AIProvider abstraction (grounded default + OpenAI/Groq/Ollama/
         OpenRouter/Gemini) + RAG retrieval layer
```

## RBAC

`superadmin > admin > manager` (admin tier) + `staff`. The bootstrap admin
is auto-promoted to superadmin. `requireRole(min)` guards account/role
management; sensitive actions append to the audit log.

## AI assistant

Retrieval-Augmented Generation over verified backend data only (traffic
stats, predictions, queue overview, staff metrics). The default
**grounded provider** answers deterministically with zero external calls;
LLM providers are opt-in via `AI_PROVIDER` and fail over to grounded.
The assistant never fabricates operational figures.

## ML pipeline

`analytics/models/train_predictor.py` trains service-time
(GradientBoosting), arrival (seasonal), and anomaly (IsolationForest)
models and exports a compact `predictions.json`. The backend loads it
(mtime-cached, with a copy shipped in `backend/models/`) and falls back to
explainable heuristics when absent — deterministic, cold-start safe.

## Free-tier constraints (deliberate)

- Firebase **Spark** plan: no Cloud Storage → shared files live in RTDB,
  bounded at 2 MB/file with strict validation.
- Render free tier: cold starts (~30 s) — the frontend tolerates them.
- All request bodies capped at 10 kB except scoped parsers
  (`/conversations` 512 kB, `/uploads` 4 MB).
