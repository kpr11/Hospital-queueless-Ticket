# Admin guide

Sign in at `/admin/login`. Sessions expire automatically (default 8 h) —
you'll be returned to the login screen with a notice.

## First-time setup (`/admin/setup`)

Organisation name, **city** (dropdown + custom), Industry Type (sets the
default queues), display-board welcome message, SLA wait target, and the
daily auto-reset time (clock picker). Saving updates the status bar
immediately.

## Dashboard (`/admin`)

- Per-counter columns: now serving (with live "serving for" timer),
  **Next in Queue** indicator, waiting list with priority/referred badges.
- **Call Next** per counter, **Call Next Priority** across counters,
  **⊘ No-show / Skip**, and **Refer to another counter →** (transfers the
  live token — it keeps its number and gets priority at the destination).
- Global pause/resume/reset, per-service pause, live announcements,
  token lookup with inline notes, SLA overdue alerts (click through to
  Analytics).
- **Display boards** panel — open a per-department board (or all
  counters) on a wall-mounted monitor.
- Metric tiles deep-link into Analytics.

## Queues (`/admin/queues`)

Create/edit/disable/archive/delete custom queues (delete is blocked while
tokens are active). Per queue: token prefix, capacity, average service
time, working hours (clock pickers), staff assignment, live analytics,
and a shareable snapshot (link + QR).

## Analytics (`/admin/analytics`)

Live data (auto-refresh 30 s) filtered to your current Industry Type /
custom queues — counters with no activity don't clutter the charts.
Includes Smart Staffing recommendations, staff performance, and the
enriched CSV export (token numbers, serving counter, organisation name).

## Team & accounts

- **Staff** (`/admin/staff`): create staff with service + optional kiosk
  PIN; presence dots show who's online.
- **Admins** (`/admin/manage`): create Admin or Manager accounts;
  superadmins can change roles inline. Managers run operations but cannot
  manage accounts.
- **Activity** (`/admin/audit`): append-only audit trail of sensitive
  actions.

## Workspace tools

- **💬 Messaging** — docked tray (bottom-right): 1:1 and group chats,
  reactions, read receipts, small attachments. Panels close automatically
  when you switch screens.
- **🔔 Notifications** — header bell + full screen (`/notifications`).
- **📁 Shared files** (`/files`) — drag-and-drop ≤ 2 MB.
